                   draft-marx-qlog-main-schema-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a high-level schema for a standardized
   endpoint logging format called qlog.  This format allows easy sharing
   of data and the creation of reusable visualization and debugging
   tools.  The high-level schema in this document is intended to be
   protocol-agnostic.  Separate documents specify how the format should
   be used for specific protocol data.

2.  Design Goals

   The main tenets for the schema design are:

   o  Streamable, event-based

   o  Flexibility in the format, complexity in the tooling (e.g., few
      components are a MUST, tools need to deal with this)

   o  Extensible but pragmatic (e.g., no complex fixed schema with
      extension points)

   o  Aggregation and transformation friendly (e.g., the top-level
      element is a container for individual traces)

   o  Explicit and human-readable

3.  The High Level Schema

   TODO: add proper data definitions for all fields (e.g., enums,
   strings vs numbers, etc. similar to what we have in the other
   document).  For now, if in doubt, refer to
   https://github.com/quiclog/qlog/blob/master/TypeScript/draft-01/
   QLog.ts

3.1.  Top level container

   To allow separate qlog traces to be contained within a single,
   encompassing qlog file, the top-level element in the qlog schema
   defines only a small set of fields and an array of component traces.
   Only the "qlog_version" and "traces" fields MUST be present.  For
   this document, the "qlog_version" field MUST have a value of draft-
   00.

   {
       "qlog_version": "draft-00",
       "title": "Name of this particular qlog file (short)",
       "description": "Description for this group of traces (long)",
       "summary": {
           ...
       }
       "traces": [...]
   }

                        Figure 1: Top-level element

   Typical logs will only contain a single element in the "traces"
   array.  Multiple traces can then be combined into a single qlog file

   by taking the "traces" entries for each qlog file individually and
   copying them to the "traces" array of a new, aggregated qlog file.
   This is typically done in a post-processing step.

   For example, for a test setup, we perform logging on the client, on
   the server and on a single point on their common network path.  Each
   of these three logs is first created separately during the test.
   Afterwards, the three logs can be aggregated into a single qlog file.

   As such, the "traces" array can also contain "error" entries.  These
   indicate that we tried to find/convert a file for inclusion in the
   aggregated qlog, but there was an error during the process.  Rather
   than silently dropping the erroneous file, we explicitly include it
   in the qlog file.

   TODO: add proper data definitions of what the "error" should look
   like

   interface IError {
       error_description: string,
       uri: string
   }

3.2.  Summary field

   In a real-life deployment with a large amount of generated logs, it
   can be useful to sort and filter logs based on some basic summarized
   or aggregated data (e.g., log length, packet loss rate, log location,
   ...).  The summary field (if present) SHOULD be on top of the qlog
   file, as this allows for the file to be processed in a streaming
   fashion (i.e., the implementation could just read up to and including
   the summary field and then only load the full logs that are deemed
   interesting by the user).

   As the summary field is highly deployment-specific, this document
   does not specify any default fields or their semantics.  Some
   examples of potential entries are:

"summary": {
    "trace_count":number, // amount of traces in this file
    "max_duration":string, // time duration of the longest trace
    "max_outgoing_loss_rate":number, // highest loss rate for outgoing packets over all traces
    "total_event_count":number // total number of events across all traces
}

   o  TODO: are there any field semantics we should specify here?

   o  TODO: Will people actually use this? or will they store this info
      out-of-band (e.g., separate database for faster querying?)

3.3.  Trace container

   Each trace container encompasses a single conceptual trace.  The
   exact definition of a trace can be fluid.  For example, a trace could
   contain all events for a single connection, for a single endpoint,
   for a single measurement interval, ...

   In the normal use case, a trace is a log of a single data flow
   collected at a single location or vantage point.  For example, for
   QUIC, a single trace only contains events for a single logical QUIC
   connection.  However, a single trace could also combine events from a
   variety of vantage points or use cases (e.g., multiple QUIC
   connections or the same connection viewed from different points in
   the network).

   The semantics and context of the trace can be deduced from the
   entries in the "common_fields" (specifically the "group_ids" field)
   and "event_fields" lists.

   Only the "event_fields" and "events" fields MUST be present.

   {
       "vantage_point": {
           "name": "backend-67",
           "type": "server"
       },
       "title": "Name of this particular trace (short)",
       "description": "Description for this trace (long)",
       "configuration": {
           "time_offset": "offset in ms",
           "time_units": "ms" | "us"
       },
       "common_fields": (see below),
       "event_fields": (see below),
       "events": [...]
   }

                         Figure 2: Trace container

3.3.1.  vantage_point

   This field describes the vantage point from which the trace
   originates.  Its value is an object, with the following fields:





Marx                     Expires April 11, 2020                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Main logging schema for qlog          October 2019


   o  name: an optional, user-chosen string (e.g., "NETWORK-1",
      "loadbalancer45", "reverseproxy@192.168.1.1", ...)

   o  type: one of four values: "server", "client", "network" or
      "unknown".

      *  client indicates an endpoint which initiates the connection.

      *  server indicates an endpoint which accepts the connection.

      *  network indicates an observer in between client and server.

      *  unknown indicates the endpoint is unknown.

   o  flow: one of three values: "client", "server" or "unknown".

      *  This field is only required if type is "network".

      *  client indicates that this vantage point follows client data
         flow semantics (a packet_sent goes in the direction of the
         server).

      *  server indicates that this vantage point follow server data
         flow semantics (a packet_sent goes in the direction of the
         client).

      *  unknown indicates that the flow is unknown.

   The type field MUST be present.  The flow field MUST be present if
   the type field has value "network".  The name field is optional.

   TODO (see issue 6): "network" should have a way to indicate what RX
   and TX mean (is current way enough? maybe identify endpoints by ID or
   4-tuple etc.)

   TODO: maybe mention what tools should do with "unknown"?

3.3.2.  Title and Description

   Both fields' values are generic strings, used for describing the
   contents of the trace.  These can either be filled in automatically
   (e.g., showing the endpoint name and readable timestamp of the log),
   or can be filled manually when creating aggregated logs (e.g., qlog
   files that illustrate a specific problem across traces that want to
   include additional explanations for easier communication between
   teams, students, ...).

3.3.3.  Configuration

   We take into account that a log file is usually not used in
   isolation, but by means of various tools.  Especially when
   aggregating various traces together or preparing traces for a
   demonstration, one might wish to persist certain tool-based settings
   inside the log file itself.  For this, the configuration field is
   used.

   The configuration field can be viewed as a generic metadata field
   that tools can fill with their own fields, based on per-tool logic.
   It is best practice for tools to prefix each added field with their
   tool name to prevent collisions across tools.  This document only
   defines three standard, tool-independent configuration settings:
   "time_offset", "time_units" and "original_uris".

3.3.3.1.  time_offset

   time_offset indicates by how many units of time (see next section)
   the starting time of the current trace should be offset.  This is
   useful when comparing logs taken from various systems, where clocks
   might not be perfectly synchronous.  Users could use manual tools or
   automated logic to align traces in time and the found optimal offsets
   can be stored in this field for future usage.

3.3.3.2.  time_units

   Since timestamps and other time-related values can be stored in
   various granularities, this field allows to indicate whether storage
   happens in either milliseconds ("ms") or microseconds ("us").  If
   this field is not present, the default value is "ms".  This
   configuration setting applies to all other timestamps and time-
   related values in the trace file and its consituent events as well,
   not just the "time_offset" field.

3.3.3.3.  original_uris

   This is an optional parameter used when merging multiple individual
   qlog files or other source files (e.g., when converting .pcaps to
   qlog).  It allows to keep better track where certain data came from.
   It is a simple array of strings.

3.3.4.  common_fields and event_fields

   To reduce file size and make logging easier, the trace schema lists
   the names of the specific fields that are logged per-event up-front,
   instead of repeating the field name with each value, as is common in
   traditiona JSON.  This is done in the "event_fields" list.  This



Marx                     Expires April 11, 2020                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Main logging schema for qlog          October 2019


   allows us to encode individual events as an array of values, instead
   of an object.  To reduce file size even further, common event fields
   that have the same value for all events in this trace, are listed as
   name-value pairs in "common_fields".

   For example, when logging events for a single QUIC connection, all
   events will share the same "original destination connection ID"
   (ODCID).  This field and its value should be set in "common_fields",
   rather than "event_fields".  However, if a single trace would contain
   events for multiple QUIC connections at the same time (e.g., a
   single, big output log for a server), the ODCID can be different
   across events, and SHOULD be part of "event_fields".

   Examples comparing traditional JSON vs the qlog format can be found
   in Figure 3 and Figure 4.  The events described in these examples are
   purely for illustration.  Actual event type definitions for the QUIC
   and HTTP/3 protocols can be found in TODO.

                       Figure 4: qlog optimized JSON

   The main field names that can be included in these fields are defined
   in Section 3.4.

   Given that qlog is intended to be a flexible format, unknown field
   names in both "common_fields" and "event_fields" MUST be disregarded
   by the user (i.e., the presence of an uknown field is explicitly NOT
   an error).

   This approach makes line-per-line logging easier and faster, as each
   log statement only needs to include the data for the events, not the
   field names.  Events can also be logged and processed separately, as
   part of a contiguous event-stream.

3.3.4.1.  common_fields format

   An object containing pairs of "field name"-"field value".  Fields
   included in "common_fields" indicate that these field values are the

   same for each event in the "events" array (with the exception of the
   "group_ids" field, see Section 3.4.2)

   If even one event in the trace does not adhere to this convention,
   that field name should be in "event_fields" instead, and the value
   logged per event.  An alternative route is to include the most
   commonly seen value in "common_fields" and then include the deviating
   field value in the generic "data" field for each non-confirming
   event.  However, these semantics are not defined in this document.

3.3.4.2.  event_fields format

   An array of field names (plain strings).  Field names included in
   "event_fields" indicate that these field names are present *in this
   exact order* for each event in the "events" array.  Each individual
   event then only has to log the corresponding values for those fields
   in the correct order.

3.4.  Field name semantics

   This section lists pre-defined, reserved field names with specific
   semantics and expected corresponding value formats.

   Only a time-based field (see Section 3.4.1), the event field and the
   data field are mandatory.  Typical setups will log reference_time,
   protocol_type and group_id in "common_fields" and relative_time,
   category, event and data in "event_fields".

   Other field names are allowed, both in "common_fields" and
   "event_fields", but their semantics depend on the context of the log
   usage (e.g., for QUIC, the ODCID field is used).

3.4.1.  time, delta_time and reference_time + relative_time

   There are three main modes for logging time:

   o  Include the full timestamp with each event ("time").  This
      approach uses the largest amount of characters.

   o  Delta-encode each time value on the previously logged value
      ("delta_time").  The first event can log the full timestamp.  This
      approach uses the least amount of characters.

   o  Specify a full "reference_time" timestamp up-front in
      "common_fields" and include only relatively-encoded values based
      on this reference_time with each event ("relative_time").  This
      approach uses a medium amount of characters.

Internet-Draft        Main logging schema for qlog          October 2019


   The first option is good for stateless loggers, the second and third
   for stateful loggers.  The third option is generally preferred, since
   it produces smaller files while being easier to reason about.

   The time approach will use:
   1500, 1505, 1522, 1588

   The delta_time approach will use:
   1500, 5, 17, 66

   The relative_time approach will:
   - set the reference_time to 1500 in "common_fields"

   Events in each individual trace MUST be logged in strictly ascending
   timestamp order.  Tools are not expected to sort all events on the
   timestamp before processing them.

3.4.2.  group_id and group_ids

   A single Trace can contain events from a variety of sources,
   belonging to for example a number of individual QUIC connections.
   For tooling considerations, it is necessary to have a well-defined
   way to split up events belonging to different logical groups into
   subgroups for visualization and processing.  For example, if one type
   of log uses 4-tuples as identifiers and uses a field name
   "four_tuple" and another uses "ODCID", there is no way to know for
   generic tools which of these fields should be used to create
   subgroups.  As such, qlog uses the generic "group_id" field to
   circumvent this issue.

   The "group_id" field can be any type of valid JSON object, but is
   typically a string or integer.  For more complex use cases, the
   group_id could become a complex object with several fields (e.g., a
   4-tuple).  In those cases, it would be wasteful to log these values
   in full every single time.  This would also complicate tool-based
   processing.  As a solution, qlog allows the extraction of group_id
   values into a separate "group_ids" field in the "common_fields",
   consisting of an array of the various present group ids for this
   trace.  If this field is present, per-event "group_id" values are
   regarded as indices into the "group_ids" array.  This is useful if
   the group_ids are known up-front or the qlog trace can be generated
   from a more verbose format afterwards.  If this is not the case, it
   is acceptable to just log the complex objects as the "group_id" for

   each event.  Both use cases are demonstrated in Figure 6 and
   Figure 7.

   Since "group_id" and "group_ids" are generic names, they convey
   little of the semantics to the casual reader.  It is best practice to
   also include a per use case additional field to the "common_fields"
   with a semantic name, that has the same value as the "group_id" or
   "group_ids" field.  For example, see the "ODCID" field in Figure 4
   and the "four_tuples" field in Figure 7.

   TODO: maybe just make group_ids or group_id reference the named field
   instead? e.g., "group_id": "ODCID"

   TODO: for the simple use case (e.g., just 1 QUIC connection in the
   trace), MUST a trace include a group_id? maybe yes: the ODCID?
   (ODCID because the normal connection IDs can change during the QUIC
   connection).

3.4.3.  category and event

   Both category and event are separate, generic strings.  Category
   allows a higher-level grouping of events per event type.

   For example, instead of having an event of value
   "transport_packet_sent", we instead have a category of "transport"
   and event type of "packet_sent".  This allows for fast and high-level
   filtering based on category and re-use of event across categories.

3.4.4.  data

   The data field is a generic object (list of name-value pairs).  It
   contains the per-event metadata and its form and semantics are
   defined per specific sort of event (typically per event, but possibly
   also by combination of category and event).

3.4.5.  Event field values

   The specific values for each of these fields and their semantics are
   defined in separate documents, specific per protocol or use case.

   For example: event definitions for QUIC and HTTP/3 can be found in
   draft-marx-qlog-event-definitions-quic-h3.

3.5.  triggers

   Sometimes, additional information is needed in the case where a
   single event can be caused by a variety of other events.  In the
   normal case, the context of the surrounding log messages gives a hint
   as to which of these other events was the cause.  However, in highly-
   parallel and optimized implementations, corresponding log messages
   might be wide and far between in time.  Another option is to use
   triggers instead of logging extra full events to get more fine-
   grained information without much additional overhead.

   For this reason, qlog allows an optional "trigger" property on the
   value of the "data" field to convey such information.  It indicates
   the reason this event occured.  The possible reasons depend on the
   type of event and SHOULD be specified next to each event definition.
   Triggers can be of any type, but are typically logged as strings.
   For an example, see Figure 8.

                         Figure 8: Trigger example

   Note: previously, triggers were also top-level fields, similar to
   category, event and data itself.  However, since many events don't
   have specific triggers and some triggers are difficult to implement
   or keep track of in an implementation flow, it was decided to make
   "trigger" an optional property of the data field value instead.

4.  Tooling requirements

   Tools MUST indicate which qlog version(s) they support.
   Additionally, they SHOULD indicate exactly which values for and
   properties of the category, event and data fields they look for to
   execute their logic.  Tools SHOULD perform a (high-level) check if an
   input qlog file adheres to the expected qlog schema.  If a tool
   determines a qlog file does not contain enough supported information
   to correctly execute the tool's logic, it SHOULD generate a clear
   error message to this effect.

   Tools MUST not produce errors for any field names and values in the
   qlog format that they do not recognize.  Tools CAN indicate unknown
   event occurences within their context (e.g., marking unknown events
   on a timeline for manual interpretation by the user).

5.  Methods of Access

   TBD : propose to use a .well-known URL to fetch logs from an endpoint
   / to send logs to.

6.  Notes on Practical Use

   TBD : discuss that implementations do not have to output qlog
   directly.  It is good practice to log in whatever way you want, and
   then just write a transformer to qlog for use in tooling.

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD : discuss privacy and security considerations (e.g., what NOT to
   log, what to strip out of a log before sharing, ...)

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  Since draft-marx-qlog-main-schema-00:

   o  All field names are now lowercase (e.g., category instead of
      CATEGORY)

   o  Triggers are now properties on the "data" field value, instead of
      separate field types (#23)

Appendix B.  Design Variations

   o  Quic-trace [1] takes a slightly different approach based on
      protocolbuffers.

   o  Spindump [2] also defines a custom text-based format for in-
      network measurements

   o  Wireshark [3] also has a QUIC dissector and its results can be
      transformed into a json output format using tshark.

   The idea is that qlog is able to encompass the use cases for both of
   these alternate designs and that all tooling converges on the qlog
   standard.
